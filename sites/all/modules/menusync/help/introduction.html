    <title>Menu Sync - Introduction</title>

    <p>Menu Sync open menu options based on the path being presented.</p>
    <p>Menu Sync is similar to <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/menutrails">
      Menu Trails</a> but it uses paths to define the pages affected.</p>
    <p>Another important difference between Menu Sync and Menu Trails is the
      method used to set the desired menu option. The method used by Menu Sync
      allows it to affect more than one menu in the same page. Apparently this
      is not possible with Menu Trails.</p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <p>All configuration is done at <i>admin/content/menusync</i>.</p>
    <p>The first step is to choose the menu that will be affected by the rule to
      be created. Click in the <i>add rule</i> link for the proper menu.</p>
    <p>At the <i>add rule</i> page the first step is to choose the menu option
      that shall be activated by the rule.</p>
    <p>The final mandatory step is to define the path of the page that should
      have the selected menu option activated. Wildcards are accepted at path
      definition.</p>
    <p>The <i>Description</i> field may hold some kind of explanation for this
      rule.</p>
    <p>As rules are checked in order and the first rules that is applied stops
      the process it might be important to change rule processing order with the
      <i>Weight</i> field.</p>
